# Research & Technical Explorations

Welcome to the Research Vault — the playground of uncertainty, curiosity, and occasional brilliance.
This directory houses comparative studies, performance analyses, and architectural musings that influenced or informed decisions in this project.

## Structure

| Folder / File                                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [databases/](databases/)                      | Evaluations of SQL vs NoSQL systems, schema design approaches, etc.         |
| [performance/](performance/)                 | Load tests, memory benchmarks, profiling data, etc.                         |
| [tools-evaluation/](tools-evaluation/)       | Reviews and comparisons of tools like IDEs, CI/CD platforms, test runners.  |
| [design-alternatives/](design-alternatives/) | Explorations of different architectures, layering strategies, and patterns. |
| [`findings.md`](findings.md)                 | Final insights, distilled lessons, and research conclusions.                |

## Usage

- Add new experiments or analyses in their appropriate category.
- When you finalize findings, summarize them in `findings.md`.
- Prefer using tables, charts, and structured formats over freeform walls of text.

## Tips

- **Be wrong boldly** — research is a safe zone to explore bad ideas until they’re proven bad.
- Cite external resources when appropriate.
- Keep version-specific benchmarks clearly labeled.
