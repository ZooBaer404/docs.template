# Buffer Management

---

## Purpose

Describe how time, cost, or resource buffers are defined and applied to absorb project uncertainties.

---

## Types of Buffers

- **Project Buffer:** Overall contingency for the project.
- **Feeding Buffers:** Buffers on critical paths feeding into the main timeline.
- **Resource Buffers:** Extra availability of critical resources.

## Buffer Allocation

| Buffer Type     | Amount Allocated     | Justification                     | Owner           | Last Reviewed    |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Project Buffer  | 10% of total time    | Historical risk data              | Project Manager | <2025-06-27 Fri> |
| Resource Buffer | 15% resource overage | To handle resource unavailability | Resource Lead   | <2025-06-27 Fri> |

---

## Buffer Usage Tracking

Track buffer consumption regularly and escalate if buffer usage exceeds thresholds.

| Date             | Buffer Type     | Amount Used | Remaining | Actions Taken        |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| <2025-06-15 Sun> | Project Buffer  | 3 days      | 7 days    | Adjusted timeline    |
| <2025-06-16 Mon> | Resource Buffer | 5%          | 10%       | Allocated more hires |

---

## Responsibilities

- **Project Manager:** Define and monitor buffers.
- **Team Leads:** Report buffer consumption.
- **Steering Committee:** Approve buffer adjustments.
