## Resource Contingency Plan

> If someone gets sick, goes rogue, or a server explodes, hereâ€™s how we bounce back.

- Maintain at least **1 backup** per key resource
- Cross-train Devs and QA in minimal tasks
- Pre-allocate **buffer time** in critical sprints
- Maintain a pool of **freelancers** or interns (if budget allows)
