## How to Use

- Start with **ci-cd.md** since you need to build the project successfully.
- Follow **deployment-guide.md** for automating infrastructure provisioning and updates.
- Use **monitoring.md** to implement reliable system health checks and alerts.
- Consult **scaling.md** to plan and execute resource scaling effectively.
- Consider have a **load-balancer.md** to keep your servers from frying.
- Work through **logging-monitoring** to have detailed log for behavior.
- Write **message-queues.md** to keep have good insights into queues, topics, and event schemas.
- Checkout **cloud.md** if any configuration changes for Cloud.
- Refer to **disaster-recovery.md** if any disaster strikes your project.
- Quickly follow **incident-reponse.md** if any incident hit the project components.

## Notes

- Infrastructure documentation aims to make environment setup and maintenance repeatable and less error-prone.
- Keep the docs up to date to reflect real-world infrastructure changes.
- Use version control for all IaC (Infrastructure as Code) files.
