## How We Use This

This file isn't just a report card â€” it's a decision map.

- Every time we complete a research doc, we summarize it here.
- It helps avoid repeating research.
- It helps justify past decisions when new team members join or management asks, "Why the hell are we using this?"

> Update this file regularly. A stale findings doc is like a map with no roads.
