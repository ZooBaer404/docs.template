## Design Review Checklist

Before submitting or exporting any design asset:
- [ ] Is it properly named and versioned?
- [ ] Does it follow the style guide?
- [ ] Has it been reviewed by at least one team member?
- [ ] Is it accessible and responsive (if applicable)?
- [ ] Has it been exported in the correct format?

---

## Update Frequency

- Wireframes – During ideation or major redesigns
- UI Kits – Updated as new components are introduced
- Branding – Rarely updated unless rebranding
- Diagrams – Every major feature or architecture change
- Exports – Updated per development sprint

---

## Notes

- Keep file names and folders clean. No "final_final_v4(1).png" nonsense here
- Version control your design work. Include changelogs if assets evolve significantly.
