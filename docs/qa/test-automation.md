# Test Automation Strategy

---

## Automation Scope

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Performance Tests (optional)

---

## Tools & Frameworks

| Tool/Framework     | Purpose                    | Notes                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Jest               | JavaScript Unit Testing    | Runs on every pull request   |
| Selenium WebDriver | Browser Automation for E2E | Integrated with CI pipeline  |
| Postman/Newman     | API Testing                | Automated via scheduled runs |

---

## CI/CD Integration

- Automated tests run on every push to `main` branch.
- Failures block deployment pipelines.
- Reports are emailed to the QA and Dev teams.

---

## Best Practices

- Write tests to be deterministic (no flaky tests).
- Maintain test data and environment parity.
- Review test coverage regularly.
- Keep automation scripts in version control with code reviews.
