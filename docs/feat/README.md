# Feature Documentation

Welcome to the Feature Docs hub! This directory contains detailed specifications, designs, and notes on all project features — the stuff that makes your software actually useful (and hopefully not buggy).

---

## Structure

- Each feature should have its own Markdown file named clearly (e.g., `user-authentication.md`, `payment-integration.md`).
- Files should contain:
  - Feature overview and goals
  - Functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
  - User stories or use cases
  - Diagrams, flowcharts, or mockups (if applicable)
  - Status and progress updates

---

## Guidelines

- Keep it clear and concise — developers and stakeholders should understand without needing a decoder ring.
- Use consistent formatting (headings, tables, bullet points).
- Link to relevant tickets, design docs, or external references.
- Update status regularly: Planned, In Progress, Review, Completed, or Deprecated.

---

## How to Contribute

1. Create a new file following the naming convention.
2. Follow the template provided in `example-feature.md` (if available).
3. Submit a PR with your updates and mention the related issue or task.
4. Add yourself or relevant team members as reviewers.

---

## Useful Tips

- Break complex features into smaller, manageable sub-features or modules.
- Keep user stories focused on value and behavior, not implementation details.
- Use this folder as a living source of truth throughout the project lifecycle.

*Remember: great features start with great docs. Don’t be lazy — document like a boss.*
